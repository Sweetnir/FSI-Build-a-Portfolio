      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded

      <div class="Favorite">
      <p> My <em>favorite</em> things about programming is that I'm learning a bunch of new info all at once, and I love the "challenge" it brings. Learning new material I never knew anything about seems scary at first but it's actually a ton of fun!
        Just the fact that I can go out and say I can build my own website seems amazing, and that I have proof to back it up. I also love that as a "Software Developer" you're never really working by yourself, you always have a team behind you 
        and I love that you can feed off each others ideas; I just love the communication this career has.

      <div id="About-Me" class="About-Me">
      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>Some things about me is that I'm a 22 year old male; born July 17, 2000. At the age of 10 I was diagnosed with Diabetes, For the first two years it was pretty tough but now I take care of myself 
        to the best of my ability because I know the consequences if I don't. But I make the best out of everything I do, I try to go above and beyond. That is why I want to become a Software Developer,
      I want to show off my skills and show the world what I can do when I put my mind towards something! Some other things about me is that I'm currently employed at FedEx, I am what you call a "switcher".
      This is someone who drives a tractor truck that has a 5th wheel on the back and it connects 28ft amd 53ft trailers to  be parked on a load dock to be loaded and unloaded onto.
    Another thing about me is that I love to play video games and I woulld like to believe I'm pretty good at it as well but what I love most about is when I'm playing with my group of friends.
  It makes the experince 100x better. Just communicating with a group of people to solve a problem or just see what type of outcome we get feels me with joy. That's why I cant wait to become a Software Developer.  </p>
